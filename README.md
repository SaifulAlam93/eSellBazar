# eSellBazar

E-SellBazar is a online shop.

Project Description: This is a E-commerce type web application. This project is developed for not only displaying and selling product but also manage the inventory system, vendor, customer, order, delivery and generate reports.

E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming commonplace.

The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where product like clothes, electronics, food items, cosmetics, fashionable items etc can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for all kinds of products. Also by flowing some rules anybody can sell his products in this shop. He can see all updates of his products. Customer can talk with the Vendor by messaging.

An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as credit card number. An e-mail notification is sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed.
